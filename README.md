The following code was sourced by a tutor:
 For Each ws In Worksheets
        LastRow = ws.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
        ws.Cells(1, 9).Value = "Ticker"
        ws.Cells(1, 10).Value = "Yearly Change"
        ws.Cells(1, 11).Value = "Percent Change"
        ws.Cells(1, 12).Value = "Total Stock Volume"
        ws.Cells(1, 16).Value = "Ticker"
        ws.Cells(1, 17).Value = "Value"
        ws.Cells(2, 15).Value = "Greatest % Increase"
        ws.Cells(3, 15).Value = "Greatest % Decrease"
        ws.Cells(4, 15).Value = "Greatest Total Volume"
